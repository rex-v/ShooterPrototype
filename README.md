Cinevva - 3D Shooter Prototype
Made by Frank Landry

Hello! To anyone viewing this, the project should be pretty straightforward.
The folder "ShooterProto" contains the game files. Extract, add via Unity Hub,
and run the game! As of the most recent version, this is how to play the game:

V1.0
Navigate in 'Assets' to the folder 'PolygonMilitary', then 'Scenes'. There should
be a scene titled "Demo" - open that, and click the play button! That's it.
